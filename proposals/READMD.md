# ASVSI Security Challenge Proposals

Welcome to the **ASVSI Community Challenge Proposal System**!

This folder is dedicated to **community-suggested security challenges**. Contributors can propose new challenges, which may later be added to the official `challenges/` section if approved.

## How it works

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch.
2. Copy the `template.md` file and fill in your challenge proposal.
3. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to `main`.
4. The ASVSI team will review your proposal based on:

   * Alignment with existing categories
   * Difficulty level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
   * Practicality and educational value
   * Avoiding duplicates
5. Community members can **react with 👍** on your PR to show interest.
6. Approved proposals will be **moved to `/challenges`** and the contributor credited.

* **Category:** Solidity, Web Security, ZK, or other.
* **No sensitive data:** Do not include real private keys, credentials, or user data.
