## 🔥 Quick overview

**ASVSI Open Security Repository** hosts small, self-contained security challenges across Solidity, web-security, cryptography, and zero-knowledge proofs. Each challenge is intentionally scoped for learning - beginners can start, contributors can add solutions, and experts can review and mentor.

Use this repo to: **try challenges, submit PRs, get contributor recognition, and level-up your security skills.**

## 🧭 How challenges work

* Each challenge lives in its own folder under `challenges/{category}/challenge-XX-name`.
* The challenge folder MUST include a `README.md` describing the goal, rules, and expected outputs, and the vulnerable code (if applicable).
* Solutions go into the `solutions/` folder inside each challenge. Contributors add one file named: `github-username.md` or `github-username.sol` or `github-username.{ext}`.
* Maintain simplicity - challenges should be solvable with basic tooling and clear guidance.

---

## 📝 Challenge README - required sections

Every challenge `README.md` should include:

* **Title & short description** (1–2 lines)
* **Difficulty** (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
* **Category** (Solidity / Web / Crypto / ZK)
* **Goal / Tasks** (What to do exactly)
* **Files included** (contract.sol, app/, etc.)
* **How to verify / run** (commands or test commands)
* **Rules** (what’s allowed / disallowed - e.g., don’t include malware, no private keys)
* **Submission** (how to add solution to `solutions/`)

---

## ✍️ Challenge template (copy for new challenge PRs)

Create a new folder `challenge-XX-title` and include a `README.md` using the following skeleton:

```md
# Challenge #XX - Short Title

**Category:** Solidity
**Difficulty:** Beginner

## Description
Short, clear description of the vulnerability or task.

## Goal
What the contributor must achieve. Example: "Exploit the contract to drain 1 ETH from Vault.sol"

## Files provided
- contract.sol
- test/ (optional)

<!-- 
## How to run / verify
1. `npm i`
2. `npx hardhat test`
-->

## Rules
- No private keys or harmful payloads.
- Keep solutions educational.

## Submission
Add your solution to `/solutions/{your-github-username}.md` or submit a PR with the fix/exploit.
```

---

## 🔁 Submitting solutions (recommended flow)

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `feat/challenge-01-yourname-solution`
3. Add your solution file under `challenges/.../solutions/your-username.md`
4. Include a short explanation, steps to reproduce, and code/test files
5. Submit a PR referencing the challenge and any related issue
6. Maintainers or peers will review, provide feedback, and merge

**Naming rule for solution files:** `github-username.md` (markdown preferred)

---

## ✅ Contribution guidelines (high-level)

* Keep posts and solutions beginner-friendly when labeled as such.
* Provide working repro steps and tests where possible.
* Do not include any sensitive data (private keys, leaked DBs, real user data).
* Follow the repository’s `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`.
* Respect reviewers' feedback - be responsive and iterate.

Read the full `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

## 🏆 Recognition & leaderboard

We want contributors to get visible credit:

* Every merged PR that adds a valid solution earns points.
* Points are tracked in `LEADERBOARD.md`.
* Top contributors get ranks and optional `ASVSI` digital badges.

If you want your GitHub profile shown on the website or in our social posts, mention it in your PR.
